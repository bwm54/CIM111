	<h1>The Joker</h1>
	<p>Once upon a time, there was a boy born of an ordinary man and woman. He was unlike ordinary boys. He didnt look up to the firemen and police. He worshiped the Fire. And the Fire rewarded him for it. No man could look beyond his eyes - for he had no soul. No God had the courage to smite - for he had no soul. He was invincible for a time. But as with all flames, they must go out. But before my kindling goes dark, i will burn one last soul. I will Burn.</p>
